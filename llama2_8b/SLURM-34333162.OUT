Congratulations on your promotion! It's understandable to feel anxious and unsure about your new role, especially if you feel like you don't deserve it. However, it's important to remember that you were chosen for this position for a reason. Your employer saw potential in you and believed you were the best fit for the job.

It's natural to have self-doubt and feel like you're not worthy of the promotion, but try to focus on the positive aspects of your new role. You have the opportunity to learn and grow in this position, and you have the support of your colleagues and employer.

It's also important to remember that everyone makes mistakes, and it's okay if you don't know everything right away. It's normal to feel like you're still learning and adjusting to your new role.

If you're feeling overwhelmed and unsure of how to proceed, consider reaching out to your supervisor or a trusted colleague for guidance. They may be able to offer support and resources to help you feel more confident in your new role.

Remember, you deserve this promotion and the opportunity to grow in your career. Try to focus on the positive aspects of your new role and the opportunities it presents, rather than dwelling on your self-doubt. Good luck!
