Sorry to hear that you and your mother fight frequently and that you've been saying hurtful things that you don't mean. It's understandable that you don't want to lose her, as she is your mother and she is important to you. Here are some suggestions that might help you improve your relationship with your mother and avoid saying hurtful things:

1. Take a break: If you find yourself getting upset or angry with your mother, take a break and take some time for yourself. Go for a walk, read a book, or do something else that helps you relax.
2. Communicate calmly: When you talk to your mother, try to communicate calmly and clearly. Avoid raising your voice or using aggressive language.
3. Use "I" statements: Instead of saying "you always" or "you never," try using "I" statements. For example, instead of saying "You always make me angry," say "I feel angry when you do this."
4. Listen actively: Make sure you are actively listening to your mother when she speaks. Look her in the eye, nod your head, and ask questions to show that you are interested in what she has to say.
5. Avoid assumptions: Don't assume you know what your mother is thinking or feeling. Instead, ask her to share her thoughts and feelings with you.
6. Show empathy: Try to see things from your mother's perspective and show empathy. For example, you might say "I can understand why you feel that way" or "That must be really difficult for you."
7. Apologize when necessary: If you have said something hurtful or regrettable, apologize. It takes a lot of courage to admit when we have made a mistake and apologize for it.
8. Seek professional help: If you and your mother have a difficult relationship and you can't seem to improve it on your own, consider seeking professional help. A therapist or counselor can provide a safe and neutral space for you and your mother to work through your issues.

Remember that improving a difficult relationship takes time and effort from both parties. It's not something that can be fixed overnight, but with patience, empathy, and a willingness to work together, you and your mother can work towards a more positive and loving relationship.
