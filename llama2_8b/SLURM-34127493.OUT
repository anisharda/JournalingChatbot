Hi! I understand. It's completely normal to feel overwhelmed with school sometimes. Here are some things you might consider doing to help manage your workload and stress levels:

1. Make a to-do list: Write down all the things you need to do, and then prioritize them based on importance and urgency. This can help you feel more in control of your work and deadlines.
2. Break tasks into smaller chunks: Large assignments or projects can feel overwhelming, but breaking them down into smaller tasks can make them feel more manageable. For example, if you have a big research paper to write, break it down into smaller tasks like researching, outlining, drafting, and editing.
3. Ask for help: Don't be afraid to ask your teachers or classmates for help if you're struggling with a particular subject or assignment. They may be able to provide additional resources or support.
4. Take breaks: It's important to take breaks and give yourself time to rest and recharge. Try taking a short walk, doing some stretching, or practicing deep breathing exercises.
5. Stay organized: Keep all your school materials, like your agenda, textbooks, and notes, organized and in one place. This can help you feel more prepared and on top of things.
6. Set boundaries: Make sure you're setting aside enough time for things that are important to you, like spending time with friends and family, exercising, or pursuing hobbies.
7. Prioritize self-care: Make sure you're getting enough sleep, eating healthy foods, and exercising regularly. Taking care of your physical and mental health is important for managing stress and staying motivated.
8. Seek support from a trusted adult: If you're feeling overwhelmed and it's impacting your ability to function, consider reaching out to a trusted adult such as a parent, guardian, or school counselor. They may be able to offer additional support or resources.

Remember, it's okay to feel overwhelmed sometimes, and it's important to take care of yourself. By prioritizing your well-being and seeking support when you need it, you can manage your workload and stay on track.
